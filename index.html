				<div id="tab-1" class="tab-content current">
					Designed for women who want to start or get back to exercising. Classes focus on whole body fitness, learning new techniques that can be done easily at home, outside in a park, or in a gym. Functional fitness builds core strength, cardio endurance and
					muscle tone, so whether your goal is weight loss, preparing for the Bolder Boulder or overall wellness, this class gives you the tools. Classes are led in a multi-station circuit structure, and routines are adapted for groups or individuals according
					to goals and abilities. All fitness levels are welcome, there is no pre-requisite or prior experience required, and classes are run in an atmosphere of mutual respect and positive energy.
				</div>
				<div id="tab-2" class="tab-content">
					Come experience the joy of group running, and take your training to the next level whether you're just beginning or have some experience. Each new class is assessed and grouped by ability and personal goals. My goal is to make running fun, and help you
					conquer your first mile or your first race in a supportive group format.
				</div>
				<div id="tab-3" class="tab-content">
					Group walking with light resistance and interval training that will add the next level of fitness to your walking routine. Body weight exercises, resistance bands and tubes are used to improve stability, strength and muscle tone. Also limited to six participants,
					meets twice a week, typically outside, weather permitting.
				</div>
				<div id="tab-4" class="tab-content">
					Want to work on an exercise program, work on specific goals, train for a race or start cross-fit, but do not know where to begin? Our individualized training and coaching plans will get you there. You tell us where you want to go, we design the plan and
					give you tools to get there. Private instruction is for anyone who prefers to work at their pace with 100% focus on their needs. Let us help you start an exercise routine for the first time, increase your level of overall fitness, rehabilitate after
					injury or surgery, or prepare for your first or next race.
				</div>
				<div id="tab-5" class="tab-content">
					Add nutrition coaching to private instruction and hit your weight, endurance or overall wellness goals faster. We provide guidance on the best foods to incorporate into your active lifestyle, as well as recommended calorie intake and recipes to get you
					going.
